## Problems:
- The tutorial I originally followed uses an outdated version of Angular, so I had to figure out how to correctly install and import firebase, as well as change a couple methods for Angular 8. People listed out corrections in the comments of the video which was helpful.
- The tutorial used a template-based form rather than a reactive form. I decided to change my app to use a reactive form since the Save button was saving the form even when data was incomplete. I was able to work this out by referencing my Challenge 4 and a few online resources, since ionic forms are different than regular angular forms.

- After changing over to using a reactive form, I realized that my update function no longer worked, and it had been depending on the properties of ngModel to repopulate the form when the user chose to update an entry. I finally found that I needed to use this.myForm.controls.MYINPUT.setValue('new value'); in order to populate the form.

- When I built my app and put it on my server, I noticed that my website didnâ€™t show the ion-icons on my buttons. This is strange because the icons worked normally on my localhost. I added a script tag in my index.html file which enables ion-icons and adding this worked. My buttons now have their icons after building the app.
