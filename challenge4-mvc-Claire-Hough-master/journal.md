## Summary
1. City component
    - Displays a list of all cities that have reviewed restaurants in them
    - Displays the number of reviewed restaurants for each city
    - Displays the total number of reviewed restaurants in the system
    - You can click on each city and see the restaurants for that city
    - At the bottom there is a link where you can add a new review
2. Restaurant Component
    - Displays a list of all restaurants in the specific city
    - Displays the cuisine served at each restaurant
    - Displays the average review (out of 5) for each restaurant
    - Displays the total number of reviews for each restaurant
    - You can click on a restaurant to see the reviews for that restaurant
    - You can click the browser's back button to go back to the city component
3. Review Component
    - Displays the list of all reviews for that specific restaurant
    - Displays the author of each review
    - Displays the rating for each review
    - Displays the body of each review
    - You can click the browser's back button to go back to the restaurant component
4. Add-Review Component
    - User can add a new city
    - User can add a new restaurant
    - User can add a new review
    - Angular validation checks to make sure form is filled out correctly
    - When the user clicks "Submit", they are redirected back to the city component

5. Architecture
    - I feel like I followed the MVC architecture pretty closely. I deal with the data in my DataService and only read/filter data in my components. There were a few times where I was copying and pasting lines of code (so I probably could've made them into their own functions), but overall I didn't repeat myself too much.
    - Angular's MVC is a little less restrictive than the MVC architecture we use in Java. Angular's use of component.ts files already kind of separates the data-handling from the view, so having DataService was more of a convienient way to keep shared/similar functions in one place and handle data safely away from the component.

7. Challenges
    - I struggled figuring out where to start. At first, I thought I should write Add-Review first so I could populate the arrays and go from there, but I eventually realized that it would be easier to write the required functions first and test them with some hard-coded data. Then I did the add-review last with a better understanding of my city, restaurant, and review structures.
    - I had trouble figuring out which type of form I should use. After reading the angular documentation, I figured out that I should use a Reactive Form.
    - Form Validation gave me some trouble since there are so many places where you have to write the validation in order for it to work.
