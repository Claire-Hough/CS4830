        About Us
        <p>This app was made by Brad Schinker, Brock Weekley, and Claire Hough as our final project for CS4830 - Web
          Application Development II at the Unviersity of Missouri, Columbia.</p>
        <p>People often form strong opinions that are reinforced when they associate with like-minded individuals. We
          wanted to shine light on differing opinions by allowing people to see the<br> true majority opinion on certain
          topics as well as give people the opportunity to see what they have in common.</p>
        <p>Our goal was to create a polling app where users can upload YouTube videos that they
          would like to know othersâ€™ opinions on, and vote on whether they agree or disagree with the<br> question being
          asked. This way, users can clearly and easily see which opinion is the majority.
