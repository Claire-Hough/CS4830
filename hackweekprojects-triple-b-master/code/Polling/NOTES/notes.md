### Admin Note

![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) `Changing the idea so that creating a poll is more universal for more users. It gets rid of the need for an admin, because all users are
admins of their own poll. Users can only have one poll available at a time to prevent spam. We would use a variable to store the poll 
ID, so that on the poll page, if the user's stored poll ID matched the current Poll page, then the user could make changes to that poll
(call the poll complete or add questions).`
